<h1>Basic Banking System</h1>

<p>
  **Project: Basic Banking System**

**Description**:  
A simple console-based banking system built in Java. It allows users to **deposit**, **withdraw**, **check balance**, and **view account info** using an organized `BankAccount` class. The project uses OOP principles, keeping account details private and secure.

**Skills Used**:  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Created a `BankAccount` class with specific actions (deposit, withdraw, etc.).
- **Data Handling**: Managed account balance and transactions securely.
- **User Interaction**: Built a menu for easy navigation and continuous use.
- **Error Handling**: Ensured valid actions like checking for sufficient funds.

**How to Use**:
1. **Run the Program**: Enter account details to create an account.
2. **Choose Options**:
   - **Deposit**: Add money.
   - **Withdraw**: Take out money (with balance check).
   - **Check Balance**: View current balance.
   - **Display Account Info**: See account details.
   - **Exit**: Ends the program.

This project is a great way to learn the basics of OOP and creating interactive programs in Java.
